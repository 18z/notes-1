    because of this. We will not be silenced."*

Pycon Ukraine

(April 20, 2018):

    Trying not to do any community engagement this month, but this is such high
    priority, and I can't stay silent. I'm so utterly heartbroken and
    disappointed to find out that there is a PyCon someplace 2018, and that it
    has 22 all male speaker lineup.
