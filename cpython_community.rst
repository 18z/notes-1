Work In Progress
================

* Reserve easy issues to non-core developers: `[python-committers] Please stop
  fixing easy issues right now! Leave them as exercices to newcomes
  <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2017-June/004564.html>`_

* Email templates:

  * `Bug triage promoted <https://github.com/vstinner/misc/blob/master/cpython/mentor_bug_triage_email.rst>`_
  * `Core developer promoted <https://github.com/vstinner/misc/blob/master/cpython/mentor_core_dev_email.rst>`_

Ideas
=====

* Organize mentoring? Make it public? List documentations for mentors?
* Django CoC: procedure to report abuse
* Thanks.Python.org - clone of https://thanks.rust-lang.org/ but with snakes üêç
  and even cuter emojis!
* Tooling to detect active contributors: number of commits, emails, reviews,
  etc. Is it doable?
* Statistics on GitHub reviews:

  * https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/reviews/#list-reviews-on-a-pull-request
  * https://github.com/joacim-boive/github-statistics # Chrome extension

* gamification: public top 5?

  * The idea is to motivate the contributors: one way is "self-motivation"
    (i.e. streak counter, daily/weekly/monthly goals, etc). Another is
    "multiplayer" (e.g. leaderboards and other "competitive" aspects).
  * Give badges depending on the number of posted bugs, PR, emails, etc.?
  * https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/

* Bot to thanks automatically new contributors with cute emojis? "Congrats üôå
  for your first PR merged into CPython üêç!" (do email notifications like
  emojis?)
* Create subteams:

  * IDLE
  * asyncio
  * Documentation
  * Windows
  * Workgroup Community // core-workflow
  * XXX: need a bot on GitHub to restrict permissions to files/directories?

* Missing in action: drop core dev for inactive developers?
